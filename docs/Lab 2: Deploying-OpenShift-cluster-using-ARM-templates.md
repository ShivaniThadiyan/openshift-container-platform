- Expires: **Never expires**

And **Click** on **Save.**

<img src="../images/21save_key.jpg"/>

11.	After you click on save, the key value will be displayed which is the Client Secret.
Copy the value into the text editor where you saved the value of Application Id for later use.
<img src="../images/22copy_key.jpg"/>

12.   Now go back to the setting blade of the App and Click on Required permissions.
<img src="../images/53req_permission.jpg"/>

### Exercise 2: Create a Keyvault 
In this exercise, you will configure Azure Bash Cloud Shell and create a Key vault in the existing resource group and store the SSH key inside the vault. 
1.	**Launch** a browser and **Navigate** to https://portal.azure.com. **Login** with the Microsoft Azure credentials you received via email.
<img src="../images/23azure_dashboard.jpg"/>

2.	**Click** on **Cloud Shell**  at the top right corner of the screen, to open the cloud shell.

<img src="../images/25selectbash.jpg"/>
<img src="../images/26advanced_settings.jpg"/>

4.	In the new blade, select the existing resource group, provide unique names under Create new(Storage account and File share) and **click** on **Create Storage**.
<img src="../images/27create_storage.jpg"/>

5.	In a few minutes, the bash shell will come up.
<img src="../images/28bashshell.jpg"/>

6.	Now execute the following command in the cloud shell to create a key vault in the existing resource group.
```
az keyvault create -n <uniquename> -g <ResourceGroup> -l <LocationOfResourceGroup> 
--enabled-for-template-deployment true
```
```
Note:
Provide the existing Resource Group name, itâ€™s location and a unique name for key vault in the above command when executing
```
<img src="../images/29create_keyvault_bash.jpg"/>

7.	Now execute the following command in the cloud shell to generate ssh key.
```
ssh-keygen
```
```
Note: Keep on clicking enter button until the key has been created.
```
<img src="../images/30generate _ssh.jpg"/>

8.	Now execute the following command in the cloud shell to display the public ssh key. Copy the key into a text editor for later use.
```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
```
Note: 
The copied SSH Key should be made into a single line. You will need this key for later use.
```
<img src="../images/31display_publickey.jpg"/>

9.	Now execute the following command to store the generated key in the key vault.
```
az keyvault secret set --vault-name <keyvaultname> -n osdemovaultsecret --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
```
Note:
Substitute for key vault name in the above command with the name of the keyvault created earlier when executing.
```
